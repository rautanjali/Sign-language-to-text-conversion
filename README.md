##Sign Language Recognition System
This project is a comprehensive solution designed for efficiently capturing and interpreting sign language gestures
through a combination of computer vision and deep learning techniques. The key features of this system include:

##Data Collection Mechanism:
 Implemented a robust data collection mechanism capable of efficiently gathering 300 samples for each of various sign languages. 
 This ensures a diverse and representative dataset for training the model.

 
##Hand Tracking Module:
 Integrated a custom Hand Tracking Module that demonstrates high accuracy in detecting and tracking hand gestures. 
 This module lays the foundation for precise and reliable input for the subsequent classification stage.
##Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:


Employed a powerful Convolutional Neural Network model for sign language classification. 
The deep learning model is trained on the collected dataset to accurately recognize and interpret various sign language gestures.


##Library Integration:
 Leveraged the capabilities of the cvzone and ClassificationModule libraries to seamlessly integrate hand detection and classification functionalities. 
 This integration enhances the overall efficiency and performance of the system, allowing for a more cohesive and streamlined workflow.

 
##Graphical User Interface (GUI):
 Developed an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides instant feedback on recognized characters.
 The GUI is designed to interpret continuous signing gestures, forming words and sentences in real-time. This feature enhances the user experience 
 and facilitates communication through sign language.
